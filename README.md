## 🧠 About Me

I am a student developer with a strong interest in **programming, logic, and digital systems**.  
I approach software development as both a technical discipline and a mindset — focused on clarity, patience, and continuous improvement.

I believe progress comes from:
- Building small things consistently  
- Understanding fundamentals deeply  
- Treating mistakes as part of the process  

I am not rushing expertise — I am **earning it**.
