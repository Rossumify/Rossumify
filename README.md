## Software Engineer || CyberSec Student & Front-End Web Developer
I build software with curiosity, structure, and a security-first mindset. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional systems while paying close attention to how things work under the hood.

Most of my work revolves around Python, JavaScript, and web technologies, where I experiment with automation, small tools, and practical applications. Along the way, I’ve developed a growing interest in cybersecurity—especially blue team concepts like system hardening, monitoring, and understanding how real-world systems fail (and how to make them better absolutley :D).
##I care about readable code, thoughtful design, and learning by doing. Whether it’s refining a feature, breaking something to understand it, or polishing details that most people overlook, I enjoy the process as much as the result.

★ Always learning, always improving, and always curious about how software and security intersect. ★
